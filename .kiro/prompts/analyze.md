Act as a Context Architect. Your first task is to explore the current directory. 
1. Use 'glob' to find all .md files and anything in .kiro/ or .cursor/ folders.
2. Read the README.md and any 'steering' or 'rules' files.
3. Identify the core logic, entry points, and architectural patterns.
4. Report back with a 'System Map' and any conflicting rules you found. Do not suggest code yet; just confirm you understand the environment.
